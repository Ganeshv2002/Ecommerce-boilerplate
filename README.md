# Ecommerce (React) Coding Assessment

# Ecommerce Boilerplate

Welcome to the Ecommerce Boilerplate repository! This project serves as a foundation for building a frontend e-commerce web application. The application includes features like product listings, detailed product views, a shopping cart, and more.

## How I Set It Up

I've designed this boilerplate with simplicity and modularity in mind. The project uses React for the frontend and Axios for fetching product data. The application allows users to browse products, view details, and add items to the shopping cart.

## Project Features

- **Product Listing:** Display a list of products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Product Details:** Click on a product to view detailed information.
- **Add to Cart:** Easily add products to the shopping cart for a seamless shopping experience.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, here are areas I would enhance:

- **CSS Styling:** Improve the overall look and feel of the application.
- **Persistent Cart Data:** Store cart details locally or in a JSON file.
- **Order Confirmation Pop-up:** Add a pop-up to confirm successful order placement.
- **User Registration Page:** Create a user registration page to maintain user data.
- **Functional Login Page:** Implement a more robust login page with user authentication.

Feel free to explore and build upon this boilerplate for your own e-commerce projects! If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or reach out.
